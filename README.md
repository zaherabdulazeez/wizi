##Visualization on the Web

Wizi provides a cross-application interface for Visulization applications like [VTK](www.vtk.org), [Mayavi](http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/) and [vispy](vispy.org) to visualize heavy data sets in a light-weight and fast manner on the web browser. 

Wizi shall make it possible to bring visualizations on to _IPython Notebooks_, deploy heavy visualizations to a remote web browser etc. Wizi uses simple image delivery mechanism to achieve this.
